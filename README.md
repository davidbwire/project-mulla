# Project Mulla

__MPESA API RESTful mediator__. Basically converts all merchant requests to the dreaded ancient SOAP/XML 
requests. It then mediating all communications to and from the Safaricom MPESA gateway frictionlessly. 
Responding to the merchant via a beautiful and soothing 21st century REST API.

In short, it'll deal with all of the SOAP shinanigans while you REST.

The aim of __Project Mulla__, is to create a REST API that interfaces with the Ugly MPESA G2 API.

Sounded like a broken record, but it was to emphasize what we hope to achieve :)

#### Since We Know, SOAP! Yuck!
Developers should not go through the __trauma__ involved with dealing with SOAP/XML in the 21st century.
